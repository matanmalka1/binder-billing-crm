No additional functionality, integrations, or behavior changes are permitted.

---

## Forbidden Changes
The following are explicitly forbidden in Sprint 4:

- Adding new notification channels (e.g., SMS, push)
- Automated billing or retainers
- Any billing logic changes
- UI redesign or UI-heavy work
- Analytics or reporting features
- Client-facing portal
- Changes to Sprint 1–3 behavior or APIs

## Change Policy
Any deviation from this specification requires:

1. A new sprint
